# movie-plus-next-app-API-Backend

This is a portfolio demo project I've built with Next JS and Express JS API. It's a SPA which is connected to an API that runs on port 3001 and the frontend application runs on port 3000.
It has a login system, you can make accounts, save and add movies, remove them or edit them.
It uses MongoDB and a couple of other libraries for uploads and processing.
